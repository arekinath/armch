Armch (arch for ARM)
====================

This is my attempt to bring pacman and some of the Archlinux base over to ARM
for the mini2440 board.

I'm using it with scratchbox2 (http://maemo.gitorious.org/scratchbox2)
and ct-ng (http://ymorin.is-a-geek.org/projects/crosstool)

Building
--------

1. Install scratchbox2 and ct-ng
2. Customise ct-ng.config to your needs
3. Customise the top of build.sh to point to your installation
4. Run 'sh build.sh'
5. Come back in a few hours :)
